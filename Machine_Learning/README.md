# 100DaysOfML - Machine Learning
I am taking up this challenge to learn Machine Learning every day for at-least one hour !!!

Here you will find the Machine learning related Techinques:

## Machine Learning Techniques

### Data PreProcessing

  - Check out the code from [here](https://github.com/mankertales/100DaysOfML/blob/master/Machine_Learning/DataProcessing.md).
  - Check out the Reference from [Ref1](https://towardsdatascience.com/ways-to-detect-and-remove-the-outliers-404d16608dba).
  - Check out the Reference from [Ref2](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning-3a5e293a5114#7559).

### Regression:

Before pitching into the world of Regression, i would like you to look into this [article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/comprehensive-guide-regression/) to get a brief idea in one shoot.
